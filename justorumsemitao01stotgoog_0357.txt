Though our notes be short and saw,
And our rests, too, oft and long,
Is we keep in tune with you,
We at last shall sing your song.

If our utmost humble powers
Here our daily prayers attend,

These poor psalma shall there, like yours,
In 0 nightless complin end.

Glory, Lord, to Thee alone,
Here below, as there above 3
May Τ1ιγ joys‚ Grcet Three in One,
Ever draw and crown our love.

Tris earlyhistoryofS. Clementis very uncertain3 but
there is reason to suppose that he was by birth 'a
Jew. He was the companion and fellow labourer of
S. Pau13 and was at Philippi in the year 62, when the
blessed Apostle wrote his epistle to the Church in
that city, as we learn from his own words, “ I entreat ,
thee also, true yoke-felloW, help those women which
laboured with me in the Gospel, with Clement 0100,
and with other my fellow labourers‚ whose names are
in the book of life¹.’' Ancient writers are agreed in
attesting his acquaintance with some os the members
of the sacred college3 and Rufinus mentions him as

¹ Philip. iv. 3.

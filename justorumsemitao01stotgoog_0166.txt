able event are full of deep thought. “ Without ex-
amining all that might be said of it, the sweetness
and peace with which the holy Virgin received the
auswer of the Lord Jesus Christ, which could arise
only from the depth of humility, seem to oblige us
to recognize in her a virtue worthy of the Mother of
Him Who is the Author of all virtues. Even if she
shewed too great haste, as some say, yet it was cer-
tainly through ignorance, as we see from the calmness
with which she submitted to His will. Full of gentle-
ness and humility, she was not discouraged by this
reproof, ifsuch it was; but knowing His charity
for men, she said to the servants, ‘Whatsoever He
saith unto you, do it.’ And her saith failed not to
obtain what her charity had asked. She thus taught
us, that the truest way of obtaining the graces of her
Son by her intercession, is to do what He commanda
us in the Gospel, and that we ought not to bc dis-
oouraged when He seems not to hear our prayers.
Itis thus that we obtain from Him even those greces
whose hour, without this, is not yet come¹.”

Alter this, the Lord went down to Capemarun
with His Mother and Hir brethren, as S. John re-
lates¹. Itis thought that He went thither chiefly
for the purpose of providing a fixed home for His
Mother3 for He Himself is found very soon aster-
wards at Jerusalem. But S. Epiphanius thinks that
she followed Him with the other holy women, who
certainly were not more worthy of the high privilege.
Yet it may have been otherwise, to teach the minis·
ters of the Church how wholly they ought to he
separated from earthly joys and domestic ties.

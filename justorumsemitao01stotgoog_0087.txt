risen from the dead¹.'’

χ The same author takes notice ofa custom which
prevails in some places of mixing the chalice with
wine of new grapes, at the adorable Sacrifice on this
day. And the reason which he gives for it is this;
“On the day of the last supper, Jesus,said to His
disciples‚ ‘Verily 1 say unto you, Ι will not drinlr
henceforth of the fruit of the vine until Idrink it new
in the kingdom of My Father.’ Since then the
Transfiguration belongs to tlrat glorious renewal
which Christ had aster His resurrection, and which
the faithful shall have aster their resurrection3 there·
fore on this feast the Blood of Christ is made of new

wine, and new grapes are blessed upon it.’' In the
Office of Sarum ia this prayer of benedictina of new
grapes on thia day: “ Bless, 0 Lord, these fruita of
the new grane, which Thou, Ο Lord, hast deigned
to bring to maturity by the dew of heaven, the fall
of rain, and the serenity of the seasonn, and which
Thou hast given us to use with thanksgiving. In
the name of our Lord »Β Jesus Christ. Per Quem·”

Good Jesn! while timc’s scroll Ι still unfold,
Do Thou to mc Thy love malta manifest,
'that 1, ’mid clouds that wrap me, may behold

Thiae everlasting glory‚ and find rest.

Hc whom 'l'hy love makes glad as with new wine,
He lmows that knowledge which is from abore ς
Fnll blest is hez that fulncsa is Divinc;
And there is nothing else that hc can lose.

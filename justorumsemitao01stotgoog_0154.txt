is not inconsistent with her marriage, aud is rather
confirmed by Scripture. The word “espoused’'
which at first presente a difficulty, may have been
used for the very purpose of expressing the angelic

union of the Blessed Maiden and her husband. In·
stances are not wanting in the annals of the Catholic
Church‚ of virgin souls who thus concealed their
dedication to Christ under the veil of holy matri·
mony.

S. Mary is generally believed to have been
very young when she was espoused to S. loseph;
perhaps she was not more than fourteen years old.
Though desceuded from kings‚ her husband was a
humble carpenter, but in the holy Gospel he bears
¹ the honourable title of “a just man.” His home was
in Nazareth, a city of Galilee, where S. Mary lived
with him. And now the fulness of time drew near,

which prophets and ltings and holy men of old had ¹

beheld afar off, with wonder and devout joy. The

words of lsaiah were about to be accomplished‚
‘⁶ Behold aVirgiu shall conceive and bear a Son, and
shall call his name Immanuel¹.’'

It belongs to the contemplatione of other festivals
to trace all the circumstances which attended the
Incarnation of our Divine Saviour. Suffice it now
to behold what happened to our Ladye herself. The
Evangelist S. Luke has recorded the salutation with
which the angel S. Gabriel greeted her3 “ Hail, full
of grace¹‚ blessed art thou among.women.’' He found
her in her chamber, alone, and far removed from the
society of men, and he bestowed on her praise from

¹ Iss. vii. 14. ² Or, highly favourcd.

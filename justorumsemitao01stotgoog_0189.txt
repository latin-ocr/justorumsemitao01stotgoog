type of the Son of Man listed up ¹. The very figure
of the Cross is contained in the mystic tau-T,-with
which the prophet Enekiel saw the messenger of
God mark the foreheads of those who bewailed the
desolation of the holy place, and who were spared in
dre destruction which followed². In the vision of
the prophetis wonderfully prefigured the sealing of
the servants of God, which the Divine John beheld
in the Apocalypse⁸. What seal but the Cross of
Christ is marked upon the foreheads of the faithful?
Other sign there is none which will have power to
stay the sword of the angel of wrath, in the dreadful
Judgment.

The figure of dre holy Crosa was thought in earlier
days to teach deep mysteries of saith. Thus S. Au-
gustin writes3 ‘⁶ This joy is signified by the breadth
of the transverse wood‚ where the hands are hxed.
By the hands, we understand works; hy the breadth,
the joy of the worker, for grief maketh narrow. By
the height, where the head is, the expectation of
reward from the sublime justice of God, Who will
render to every one according to his works. So the

length, hy which the whole body is stretched‚ signi-
fies endurance‚ whence they are called long-suffering

¹ who endure. The depth, which is fixed in the earth,

prefigures the secretos the sacrament. For you
remark the words of S. Paul‘3 ‘That ye being
rooted and grounded in love, may he able to compre-
bend, with all saints, what is the breadth, and length,
and depth, and height, and to know the love of Christ,
which passeth knowledge ⁸.’ '¹

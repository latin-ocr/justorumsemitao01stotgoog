present church was built chiefly in the thirteenth
century, during the reign of king Henry 111. Many
’ of the sovereigns of England were great benefactors
to it. Early in the sixteenth century, king Henry

VII. added the chapel which bears his name. It is
now used as the chapel oi the knights of the Bath.

The ahhey was surrendered in 1540, to K. Henry
V111, who erected it into a cathedral lor the diocese
os Middlesex. Thomas Thirlby held the see till the
king's death. On the accession of K. Edward, the
new bishopric was abolished, and more than half of
the property os the abbey was seined hy the Lord
Protector. In 1550 “the king sent a letter,” says
Collier, “ for the purging his library at Westminster.
The persons are not named, but the business was to
cull out all superstitious books, as missale, legende,
and such like, and to deliver the garniture of the
books, being either gold or silver, to Sir Anthony
Archer. These books were many of thern plated
with gold and silver, and curiously embossed: this,
as far as we can collect, was the superstition that
destroyed them. Here avarice had a very thin dis-
guise‚ and the courtiers discovered oi what spirit they
were, to a remarkable degree.” Three'years after-
wards, the sacred vessels and the vestments of the
church were delivered uptothe king's commissionem¹.
In 1556, Quaen Mary restored the monks to their
house, and appointed Feckenham to be their abbat.
He repaired the shrine os S. Edward, as we now
see it. Queen Elisabeth drove the hrethren of S.
Benedict once more from the abbey, and it became
a collegiate church for a dean and prebendaries.

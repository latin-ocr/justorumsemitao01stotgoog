which may savour of elation of mind. And you, 0

contempt, and injuries, and shame, band together '

and rush in upon ure as towards a good, and avenge
the despite which Ι have offered to God¹.” And,
again, S. Bernard remarks, “ Against the conscious-
ness of sin, the remedy of confession has been ap-
pointed: and all things are washed away in confes-

sion. Behold‚ these are the things which cleanse the “

eye of the hean, prayer and confession¹.'¹

Judge of Jnrtice, Thea, 1 pray,
Grant me pardon while I may,
Ere that awiul reckoning Day.

O'er my crimes I guilty grean,
Blnah to think whct 1 have done ς
Spore thy suppliant, Holy One.

Thon didst set th’ adulteress fres,
Heardst the thies upon the tres,
And hast given hope aven to me.

Suppliant, fallen, low 1 bend,

My bruised heart to ashes rand,

Care Thou, Lord, for my last end.
Dies Iro.

Catholics paid to relics, and accused them of wor· ³

shipping the saints. “ Who, Ο madman, ever adored
the martyra ?” cries S. Jerom. ‘⁴ Who ever thought

that man was Godl . . . . But you are grieved that ’

the relies of the martyra are enclosed in a precious
covering, and are not wrapped in coarse rags or in
sackcloth, or thrown on the dunghill. Are then all
the bishops not only sacrilegious but infatuated, who
have borne in silkeu cloths and in vessels of gold a
most vile thing, a lew perishing ashes? Are the
people of all the churches fools, who go out to meet
the holy relies ¹, and receive them with as much joy
as it they beheld a prophet alive and present among

theml So that from Palestine to Chalcedon, vast '

multitudes of people are united, and with oue voice
resound in the praiscs of Christ.'’

“ The Apostles once complained that the ointment
was wasted, hut the Lord rehuked them,'’ he rc-
marks, in defeuce of lighted tapers in theffdaytime.
“ For Christ needed not ointment, nor the martyrs
waxen tapers; and yet that woman did this in honour
of Christ, and her' devotion of mind is accepted;
and those who kindle tapers have their reward ac-
cording to their saith, as the Apostle saith, ‘Let
every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.¹
And, without relies of the martyre, lights arekindled
when the Gospel is read, throughout all the churehes
of the East, and while the sun is shining3 not to
chase the darkness, but as a sign of joy. Thus drese
virgins of the Gospel have their lamps ever burning.'’

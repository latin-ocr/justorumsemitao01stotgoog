Collier, aller mentioning their names, remarks, ‘⁶ As
for S, Alban’s miracles, being attested by authors of
such antiquity and credit, Ι do not see why they should
bc questioned. That miracles were wrought in the
Church at this time of day, is clear from the writings
of the ancients. To suppose there are no miracles
but those in the Bible‚ is to believe too little. To
imagine that God should exert His omnipoteuce‚
and appear supematurally sor His servants in uo
place but Jewry‚ and in no age since the Apostles, is
au unreasonable fancy: for since the world was not
all converted in the Apostles’ time, and God designed
the further enlargement of His Church, why should
we not believe He should give the pagans the highest
proof of the truth of Christianity, and honour His
servants with the most undisputed credentials. Now
if this is very reasonable to suppose, why should S.
Alban's miracles be disbelieved, the occasion being

χ great enough for such an extraordinary interpositionl
’ For, by this means the martyr must have been

mightily supported, the British Christiane fortified

against the persecutiou‚ and the pagane surprised

into a conversion⁸.”

The spiritual father of the saint„ as the holy priest
who baptiaed him is called in the language of early
times, escaped into Wales, and alter converting many·
to the true Faith, received the crown ol martyrdom

l in the same persecutiou. His name is supposed by
p some historiens to have been Amphibalus‚ though

y
l

others allege that this was only au epithet horrowed
from the cloak which he wore.

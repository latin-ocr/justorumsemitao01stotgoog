S. Giles has always been highly venerated in France
and Belgium, and in other countries. In Britain, at
this day, many churches bear his name. ln 1117,
Matilda, the wife of king Henry Ι., founded an hos-
pital for lepers without the walls of the city of Lon-
don, under his invocation. lt gave its name to the
parish in which it was situated, and afterwards be-
came a cell to the hospital of Burton S. Lazarus
of Jerusalem. The master and hrethren 01 S. Giles
used formerly to present a howl of ale to every felon,
hs he passed their gate on his way to Tybum.

S. Giles is the patron or tutelar saint of Edinburgh.
In the fisteenth century, during the reign of king
James ll., Prestou of Gortou brought an arm hone of
the saint to the Scottish capital, by the favour 01 the
king of France. He bestowed it on the church of St
Giles, and the magistrates, out 01 gratitude, granted
a charter to his heirs, in virtue of which they had
the right to bear the holy relic in all public proces·
sions. The citizens also founded and endowed an
altar, and appointed an armual solemn mass of re·
quiem to be sung for the soul of the donor. The
relic was enshrined in silver, and was preserved with
becoming honour till the ancient faith was abolished.
lt was then destroyed, and its costly shrine, with the
other sacred vessels of the church, was sold for the
benefit 01 the corporation.

The parish church of Edinburgh was probably
founded in 854. It certainly existed under the invo-
cation of S. Giles in 1359. Part of the building, 01
which the wreck still remains, was finished in 1380.

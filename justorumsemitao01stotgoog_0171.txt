holy demeanour, were the only assistance which she
could give to the Church. Though we may well

1 the knowledge of the Conception, and the Birth and
¹ Infancy of ourLord. S. chrysostom indeed thought
that these mysteries were made known to the Evan-
gelists directly by the Holy Spirit; but He osten

We leam from the early histories of the Church,
, that the Blessed Virgin went to Ephesus with S. John,
and probably with S. Mary Magdalene, and that she
diedthere in extreme old age. Sheisgenerallybelieved
to have been buried there; and in a letter written by
1 the third Catholic council at Ephesus, in 431, men-
, tion is made of her tomb. An opinion has for many
ages prevailed, in the eastern and western Churches,
that within a few days after her death her body
was miraculously revived, and caught up to heaven;
thus only anticipating the blissful consummation for

l devotion. It is called by the Greek Chureh her
Sleep, and her Assumption, by the Latin. without
examining at length the evidence on which it rests, we
may remark, that the universal belief which it has
received for more thau a thousand years, in the
east and west, may be set against the silence which
prevails regarding it among all the Christian fathers
before S. Gregory of Toum, in the sixth century.

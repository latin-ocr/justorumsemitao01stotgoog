AUGUST.

Auuusu l.

burrum bau.

Tne name of this holyday is a corruption of Loaf·
mass‚-e Feast of thanlrsgiving for the first fruits of
the coru, which was annually observed in England
in the beginning os August. Bread made os the new
wheat was offered at the mass of this day, arrd was
solemnly blessed3 and hence, in many parts of Eng-
laud‚ tenants were bound to bring in wheat of that
year to their lords‚ on or before the lst of August.
The day was kept with great festivity.

Some antiquarium derive the name of Lammas
from Lsmbmass3 because it wasa condition on
which the lauds ol' the cathedral church of York
were let, that the tenants should offer a lamb yearly
at the mass of this day. But this seems to have been
only a local custom.

The blessing of new fruits was performed annually
iu the Eastem and Westem Churches on the let, and
sometimes on the 6th of August. It is mentioned on
the latter day irr the Sacramentary of S. Gregory.

The benediction took place in the canon of the. Mass,

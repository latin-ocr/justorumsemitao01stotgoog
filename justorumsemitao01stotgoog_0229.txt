about the year 342, though some historiatis have
³ lixed it a few years earlier. His father Eusebius

was rich, and spared no pains with his education.
He was sent to Rome, to finish his studies under

Donatus, a famous grammarian. There he made
great progress in the Latin and Greek languages‚

l aud other branches of human learning. But the
¹ temptations of the luxurious capital, and the ex·

ample os his companions, carried him away for a

= time into open excesses‚ while the grace was wanting

which flows through the holy sacrament of regene-
ration. For Jerom was yet unbaptized. Yet even

then, signs of his future piety marked his course. ⁴

He has himself described how “ when he was a boy,
he was wont on Sundays‚ with others of the same
age and inclinations‚ to visit the catacombs and
cemeteries beneath the earth, where the bodies of the

Ἴ holy apostles and martyra rested¹.”
. When his studies were finished, he pleaded for

some time at the bar with great applause. He was
also diligently occupied in transcribing books for his

, library. In order to increase his knowledge, he underss

took a joumey into Gaul, and visited several schools

, ofleamingwhich were established there. At Treves

he remained for sometime, with Bonosus, a compa-

ἕ nion os his travels. During his stay, his heart was

converted to God 3 he renounced the pleasures which
had hitherto engaged him, and dedicated himself
wholly to the Divine service by a vow of perpetual
celibacy. He went to Aquileia in 372, to enjoy the
society of the holy bishop Valeriam and the learned

, aud saiutly men whom he had gathered around him.

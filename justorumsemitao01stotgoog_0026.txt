other sees were invested with the metropolitan rank3
but among these Meutz retains the primacy. It
originally possessed jurisdiction over thirteen bishop·

S. Boniface in the year 7 46 founded the Benedic-
tine monastery of Fulda, on the confines of Bavaria.
It became the most famous school in the West,
during that age and the next. The first superior
was S. Sturmius, a Bavarian, who had been educated
in the convent at Frislar, and aster searching for

some time for a suitable situation, at last, with the

consent of Boniface, began to build on the banks of
the river Fulda. The pope endowed it with singular
privileges, and granted it full exemption from all
episcopal jurisdiction‚ except that of the Roman see.
This seems tn be the first instance which has been
recorded of auch a remarkable liberty having been
given. In later ages it became very general. The
superior of Fulda ia now aprince of the empire, and
is styled primate of all the abbata of Germany.
Prince Carloman about this time withdrew from
the world, and made a profession of the religious
life in a monastery near Rome. He afterwards
retired for greater privacy to the Benedictine house
at Monte cassino, and ended his days in peace at
Vienne in 755. His brother Pepin thus became
sole prince of the extensive dominions in Gennany
and France which Charles Martel had bequeathed.
For nearly a century, the French kings had been
weak and indolent, and the sovereign authority had
been intrusted to the Maire du Palaia. This office,
after having been the cause of many wara, had be-
come hereditary before the time of Charles Martel.

leth of February, and come modern historians
l‘ incorrectly that the latter was in honour of the
'nval to Shalleabury, while the other, on the aoth
lune, was in commemoration of a translation of the
ἵ body to Glastonbury. But there is no reason
uppose that the body of S. Edward was ever at

Yet for their bones mech Piety shall plead,
Bleal Phry, which honouroth the dead!
Though acattered sar and wide, yet God's own eye
Doth keep them that they periah not ;and when
'l'he promised hour shall come, their God again

Shall gether them, and as Ha builds on high
Hie habitatin, each there, moulded by His grace,
Shall live and huda aure abiding place.

Hymos from the Pariaian orel-ary, p. 266.

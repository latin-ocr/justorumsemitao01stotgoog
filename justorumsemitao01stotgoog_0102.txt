to Pope Hormisdss torequest a relic of S. Laurence.
He refused to send any part of the martyr’s body,
but gave him a small filing of the gridiron on which '
he had suffered, and which was preserved with great
care. A similar gift S. Gregory tbe Great sent to a
lord of France, who had begged it ot' him.

The martyrdom of S. Laurence is said to have
been as glorious to the Roman Choreb, as that of
S. Stephen was to the Church of Jerusalem, in earlier
days. And the conversion of the city of Rome from
paganism to Christianity which shortly followed it, is
universally attributed to his prayers. His name has
been celebrated by some of the most eminent of the
ancient fathers. S. Ambrose, 'S. Augustin, S. Peter
Chrysologus, S. Leo, and S. Maximus of Turin, have
mentioned him in their writings, with the highest
honour. Prudentius in his great poem Os the Crotone
has related many particulare of his passion. Itis
from these early writers chiefly that we know the
history os bis life and death, sorbis Acts are wholly
without credit.

The noblest monument of devotion to S. Laurente
is the royal palace ot' the Escurial, about fisteen
miles from Madrid It was begun in 1557, by
Philip 11. of Spain, out os gratitude sor a victory
which he had gained, on the feast of S. Laurence, at
S. Quentin in Picardy‚ over the French army3 and it
is named from a small village near it. Itis built in
the form of a gridirom of which the royal apartments
form the handle3 iu the centre is the'church, and
on either side are the palace and the convent and
library arranged in many courts, arcades, and clois-
ters, and inelosing beautifirl gardens within them.

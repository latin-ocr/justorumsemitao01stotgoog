ever honour; but yet not the effigy, but Whom it
representa, adore3 for what the image teaches is
God, hut itself is not God. Look then upon it, and
in thy mind worship what thou seest in it.”

The antiquity of roods is very great. Every
chnrch in England formerly possessed one. They
were also common in the continental churches till
the Revolution in the end of the last century. In
hngland the work of destruction was begua by K.
Henry vna, and was continued in his aon's reign3
hut Q. Mary’s accession put a stop tait for a time.
At her death the ancient roods were every where de·
stmyed with savage violence. We read of “ asermon
preached, November 4, 1559, at S. Botolph‚ Bishops-
κ gete, at the wedding osa prieat to a priest’s widow of
ware, by one West, a new doctor, who took occa·
sion to speak freely and eamestly against the Rood-
lolls¹.”

The very form os a Catholic Church osten repre·
senta the Crosa of Christ: the chancel‚ or eastern part,
isthe head, the transepts form the arms, and the body
os the cross is the nave3 and the high altar, whence the
Sacrifice ascende, represents the heart. So closely
was the Redeemer’s Crosa sometimes imitated in old
charchea, that a second transept was added, as at
Yorls, Salisbnry, and many other places, to signify
the writing which Pilate affixed to it3 and the re·
markable inclination towards one side, which was
often given to the principal altar, is believed to sha-
dow forth the drooping of the adorable head of the
Lamb of God in death.

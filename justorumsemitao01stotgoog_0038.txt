The rernains 01 the blessed Alban were buried in
the place where he suffered. It was called by the

cinglo-Saxona Holmhurst, or the woody place, and ,
in later times Derswoldwood; and the present town 1

01 S. Albau's is built upon it. When the Gallican

bishops‚ Germanus and Lupus, carne into Britain in r
' the lillh century, to stay the progress 01 the Pelagian 1
heresy, they held a great conserence at S. Alban’s‚ 1
where its supportem were refuted, and the Faith was ’ἱ

established by the evidence 01 miracles. “They
gave tharrlts to God,’' says Ven. Bede, “through the
holy martyr Alban3 and Germanus, who had brought ‘
with him relies 01 the Apostles and os many martyrs,
aller praying, ordered the sepulchre of the proto-

martyr te be opened, and placed in it the precious ¹
treasure3 for he deemed it fitting that the bones which '

had been gethered in different countries should rest

in oue tomb, since they had belonged to saints who ⁴

had been received with equal honour in heaven. He
accordingly laid thern with great reverence in the spot

where the blood 01 the blessed martyr had been shed, “

and he carried away a handful 01 dust, which still
preserved the colour 01 blood⁴.”

The choreb, which had been built in mernory 01
S. Alban, was destroyed by the Saxons, and his
precious rernains were left for many years in an un·

honoured tomb. Offa, king 01 Marcia, was divinely l

admonished, as it is related, in 793, to take them up

and translate them toaworthier place. He builta ,

noble church, and founded a monastery for a hundred
monks, probably 01 the Benedictine order. ln 930 3

“The blessed Alban suffered on the nand of June, .‘

near the city of verolamium, where allerwards, when

peaceful times returned, a ehurch of glorious form 2
was built, worthy of his martyrdom. In this place Ιῑ
the cure of the sick, and the perfonnance of frequent ,

miracles, cease not at this day to be witnessed. There
suffered also at the same time Aaron and Julius,
citizens of Caerleon, and many other men and women ‘2
in different places. They were tortured in many
cruel ways, and their limbs were torn and mangled
in a manner unheard of ; and having finished their
agony, their souls were dismissed to the joys of the
-city above.

“ When the storm of persecution had abated, the
faithful ones of Christ came forth again in public,
from their hiding-places in the forests and deserta and

secret caves, which had concealed them in the time of ⁴

danger3 and they rebuilt the churches which had been
levelled to the ground, and founded, and built, and
beautified the shrines of the martyrs3 and showed
them openly asbanners ofvictory3 and commemorated
their festival days, and celebrated the sacred mysteries
with clean hearts and lips. And this time of peace
lasted iu the churches of Christ which were in Britain
till the appearance of the Arian heresy².'’

The miraculous circumstances of S. Alban's mar· ’

tyrdom are attested by many ancient historiens.

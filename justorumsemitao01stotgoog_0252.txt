Rome, in S. Mark's at Venice, and at Milan, the
old Italic psalter is still used. The council os
Trent declared the Latin Vulgata to be an authentis
translation of the holy Scriptures, but gave full
liberty to any persons to consult them in the original
langusges. ln the English psalter, the words os
intonation of each psalm are taken from the Latin
Vulgate, though the general translation follows more
closely S. Jerom's own version from the Hebrew.
The psalter in the English Bihle is still nearer it. Itis
perhaps needless to mention that the 9th psalm, Confi·
tebor Tibi, in the Latin Vulgata, includes the 9th and
10th in the English psaltes. The nath psalm, In exitu
Israel, contains the ll4th and ll5th of the English
version. The 114th, Diless’ quoniam, ends with the
ninth verse of the English 116th psalm, and the
tenth verse, Credidi, is the first of the Vulgate noth.
And the 147th psalm, Lauda Jerusalem, in the Vul-
gate begins with the twelllh verse ol the English
147th.

S. J erom also wrote many treatises in explanation
of holy Scriptura, and commentarios on the prophets

book Of ecclesiastical writers, which contains the l
names of all who had illustrated the Christian saith
hy their works, from the blessed Prince of the ,
Apostles till his own day. His labours against the ¹
enemies of the Church we have already seen. The ,
greatest monuments of his real and learning, besides l
his treatises on holy Scripture, are his books against

Helvidius, Jovinian, vigilantius, and Rufinus ς. and

his Dialogues against the Pelagians. More tharra
hundred of his epistles have been preserved. The

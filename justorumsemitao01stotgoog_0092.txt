and the whole company of the faithful were assembled,
and were praying that God would stretch forth His
hand to heal, and that many signs and wonders
might be done by the name of His holy Child Jerus,
the place was shaken where they were assembled
together, and they were all filled with the Holy
Ghost². “This miraculous Name‚'’ says bishop
Taylor, “is above all the powers of magioal enchant-
ment, the nightly rites of soroerers, the secrets of
Memphis, the drugs of Thessaly, the silent and
mystanous murmurs of the wise Chaldees, and the
spells of Zoroastres. This is the Name, at which the
devils did tremble, and pay their enforced and invo-
luntary adorations‚ by confessing the Divinity, and
quitting their possession and usurped habitations. If
our prayers be made in this Name‚ God opens the
windows of heaven, and rains down benediction: at
the mention of this Name the blessed Apostles, and
Hermione, the daughter of S. Philip, and Philo-
theus, the son of Theophila, and S. Hilarion, and S.
Paul the Eremite, and innumerable other lights, who
followed hard after the Suu of Righteousness,
wrought great and prodigious miracles. This is the
Name which we should engrave in our hearts and
write upon our foreheads, and pronounca with our
most harmonious acoents, and rest our faith upon,

¹ had opposed the election of S. Cyprian. He toowas
³ guilty ol' serious crimes. They retired to amountaiu,

l

where they celebrated their worship, incompany with
the rest of the clergy who had taken part against the
holy bishop. Cyprian excommunicated them, and

y cautioned the people against their error.

In the same year, Cornelius was chosen Bishop of
Rome. Novatian, a priest in his diocess, protested‚
and made a schism. He prevailed on three bishops
from the country to come to Rome and consecrate
him as the successoros S. Fabian. He affected a
great regard for canonieal discipline, and made its
violation achiel cause of complaint against his bishop.
lu the end his extreme doctrine became heresy3 for
he taught that none who have soiled their baptismal
robe with the stain of mortal sin can be'restored by
penance to the communion of the Church. His fol-
lowers were called from him Novatians. Iu him we
behold another of those presumptuous assailants of
holy Chnrch, who wasted their fury upon the eternal
rock on which she stands, but their names now serve
only as heacons to warn others from a course so
perilous. “ Whosoever shall sallon this stone shall he
broken, buton whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind
him to powder¹.”

S. Cyprian returned to Carthago in 251, and cele-
brated the festival of Easter among his flock. Soon
asterwards he held a council to consider the affairs os
his Church. Deputies were sent to Rome to examine
the circumstances os the schism of Novariam that the
African Church might know with whom to hold eom·

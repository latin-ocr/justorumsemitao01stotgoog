The very Fiend of hell himself seemed 10 110 101

10000 upon the domain 01 the men 01 peace. But .

even the poor remains 01 1110 saints 01 God, andos

the faithful departed in Christ, may not with im-

punity be trodden under the 100101 the unholy. The ,ἵ

once joyous France are not needed to attest this. j

S. Denys‚ bishop 01 Ρο110, ought not 10 110 con·

founded with the Areopagite 01 the same name. In

many copies 01 the English Kalendar we find the ,

latter saint commemorated on this day. Itis 001

unlikely that the compilers 01 the Kalendar consi-

dered them as one person, and 1110 00100 opinion is

found in the Roman Breviary. But inother parts 01 =

the Church the Areopagite is honoured 00 a distinct ³

person, and by a separate festival on the 3d 01 0010- .

ber. He is supposedtohave beena native 01 Thrace.

When S. Paul visited Athens, 110 was a member 01

the court 01 Areopagus, the supreme tribunal 01

justice in that city ¹. The sermon 01 the Apostlc was

the means 01 converting him to God. Damaris,

whose name is also mentioned in the sacred history,

is thought by some to have been his wife. He be-

came the first bishop 01 Athens, and received the

palm 01 martyrdom in the reign 01 Domitian. He is

honoured on the ad 01 October in the Eastand West.

The writiugs which are usuaily ascribed to him 010

001 01 earlier date than the 0111111 century. His head

is believed to be in the treasury 01 the church 01

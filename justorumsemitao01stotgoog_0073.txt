generally honoured even in the age of S. Bemard.
Tne name of S. Joachim is found, probably for the
first time, in a martyrology dated 1491, on the 9tb of
September. Some of the relics of S. Anne were sent
to Chartres in 1200, by Louis, Count of Blois.

The history of Joachim and S. Anne must ever
l remain unknown to us, as no record of it is preserved

during the first ages, and the later accounts are
entirely fabulous. But as we honour them, not so
much for their own sakes, as because they were the
parents of the Mother of God, we do not ask for any

further information regarding them. And even if ¹

their very names were imaginary, we might still com·
memorate their persons with true devotion. But it
seems an unreasonable suspicion of the early Church
to doubt that it had the best authority for enrolling
these names in the catalogue of saints. None can
doubt the existence of the persons, unless the Blessed
Virgin herself is a Catholic fiction.

We may not venture without reverence to with-

, draw the veil, even in thought, which conceals the

early life of the blessed Mary. Itis a theme which
bas inspired the great Catholic painters with the
loveliest conceptious. Behold the mother tending
the gentle child, in whose infant countenance hu-
mility is so mysteriously blended with thought
deeper than a child’s. As yet the soenes of the
Annunciation, and the Nativity‚ and all that followed,
lie deeply hidden in futnrity. God is training His
chosen to sulfil her part. How high and solemn, and
bow encompassed with suffering! Earthly language
fails to express the thoughts which even our cold
hearts conceive, much less can it give uttersnce to the.

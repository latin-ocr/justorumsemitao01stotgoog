quently asked his advice in the govemment of bis
see, aad took him with him on bis joumeys to distant
parts of his diocese, that he might have the assistance
of the praycrs and holy example os his guest. Ma-
chutus was not nnmindfirl, in his exile, of bis own
rebellione children, but daily implored the divine
mercy to visit them and dispone them to penitense.
His prayers were heard, and he was permitted once
again to give them his benedictina.

As be was on his way to Saintes, to renew his
friendship with Leontius, he was overtaken by mor-
tal illaess, aad gave up his toul to Christ, lying
on sackclotb and ashes, on the 15tb of November,
564, or, as some say, in the following year. The see
of Aleth was afterwards removed to tbe town of S.
Malo, which bears bis name, and his body was trans·
lated thither. For sear os tbe Danes, as the Parisian
Breviary informs us, bis relies were in later years
removed to Paris.

Not by tbe martyr’r death alone
'Phe martyr’s orown in heaven is won ;

'lbere is a triumph robe on high
For bloodleas fields of victory.

What though not taught the llame to leel,
The lion den, tha torturing wheel ς
Himself bis only enemy,

He learns a living death to die.

What tbongb nor executioner,

Nor scourge, nor stake, nor chains be there,
To those prepared with Christ to die

’nis all supplied with charity.

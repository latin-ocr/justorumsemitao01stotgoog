that “Jesus, who was then conceived in her womb, l

hastened tosanctify John in the womb of his mother.” , ÷
This opinionis confirmed by S. Ambrose‚ who alleges Ϊ

it as a reason for supposing that the blessed Virgin 1

was present at the birth of S. John Baptist. ‘⁴ If at ιἔ

her first coming‚” he says, “such was its effect, that l

at the salutation of Mary the babe leaped for joy, '
and his mother was filled with the Holy Ghost, of .
how great service may we suppose the presence ol ³
holy Many, for so long a time, to have been. For
not her relationship only is the cause of her stay, but y
the advantage osso great a prophet.’' ¹

The house of Zacharias was probably in Hebron,
which was one of tbe cities of the priests, as we leam

from the book of Joshua'. Thus, fromherownhome l

at Nazareth, S. Mary had to travel nearly the whole l
length of J udea. When she arrived in the house of Χ
her cousin, she was silent regarding the great things

which God had done to herself, till they were revealed ,

to S. Elizabeth by the Holy Gbost. And when the ³
mother of the Baptist in the words of inspiration l
hailed her as the Mother of her Lord‚ she gave utter-
ance to the joy of her holy soul in the divine hymn
which the Church has for many ages sung in her ¹
evening office. “Not only in her silence is the hu-
miliiy of Mary commended to us‚” says S. Bemard,

“but it is proclaimed more evidently in her words. ¹

She was told that the Holy One should be born os
her, and she answered only that she was His hand-

maiden. Then she came to Elizabeth‚ to whom the
singular glory of the Virgin was immediately revealed

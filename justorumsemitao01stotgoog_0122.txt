thrd oouncil os Carthage was held. It is remarkable
aa having been the last Westem synod which settled*
the canon of holy Scripture till the council of Trent,
eleven centurias and a half later, which only con-
firmed the decision of the ancient council regarding
the canonical books.

S. Augustin had written to S. J erom, in 395, re-
monstrating with him against an interpretation which
he had given of the conductos S. Peter and S. Paul
at Antioch ¹, in his commentary on holy Scriptura.
Their correspondence on this subject was renewed
at intervals during the next ten years. S. J erom
seems to have acknowledged the justice of S. Au-
gustin’s objections.

ln 407, the emperor Honorius enacted severe laws
against the Donatista and the Manichees‚ as the
principal disturbare of the peace of the Cburch in
Africa. S. Augustin went to Calama in 408, to
allay a serious tumult which had taken place iu con·
sequence osan attempt made by the clergy to pre·
vent the celebration of a pagan festival. The hea-
thens attached the Christiana, and drove them away
with a shower of stonea; and when justice was

demanded they renewed their violence, burned their
church, and killed some of them. The biahop of

the place was obliged to conceal himself. The
emperor again published his edicts, forbidding the
enemies of the Church to hold any assemblies for
religioua worship.

111410, Rome was taken and pillaged by Alaric,
king of the Goths. Many os the Christiana escaped

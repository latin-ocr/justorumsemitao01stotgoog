nicles that her body was transported thither by
angele, nothing more is meant than that the monks

, themselves conveyed it with reverent hands to their

house in the desert. From that time we hear more

,ι of S. Katharine and her relies. The devotion to

her memory probably passed into the west in the

, age of the Crueades. Paul, the holy hermit of
ξ Latro, in the tenth century, celebrated her festival

with great solemnity. Simeon, amonh of Mount
Sinai, coming to Rouen to receive an annual alms

from Richard‚ duke of Normandy, in the eleventh

ι, century, brought with him relies of the saint, which

he deposited in a monastery near the city. Her
name then began to be venerated in France.

A holy well near Edinburgh still bears the name
of the virgin martyr. Hector BoethiuS, in his His-
tory of Scotland, says os it :-“ About two miles
dietam from the town, more or less, a fountain flows,
on which drops of oil float in such abundance, that
however much you take away, not the less remains.

“ They say that it arose from a drop os the 011¹ of

S. Katharine, which was brought to S. Margaret²
from Mount Sinai. And the truth of this is attested
by the name of the blessed Katharine, which is
given to the fountaim and hythe chapel which was

; built in her honour near the place, by command os
' S. Margaret. This oil has great virtue in healing

diceases of the skin.”

¹ ‘⁴ Wbether thie oil flowed from the bodies of the sainte?
aayo Mebillon, De Ouo. Sonat. Inooym't. xix, “or whether it
wau taken from the lampa which burned before their relico,

ἰ), ianot clear. The latter seems to me much more probable.”

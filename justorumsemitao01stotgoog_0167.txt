r In the second year of our Lord’s ministry‚ as He

was teaehing the people in a certain place, “A
woman of the company listed up her voice and said,
Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps
which Thou hast suoked. But He said, Yea, rather
blessed are they that hear the Word of God, aud
keep it¹.” Many ancient writers remark that the
Lord would thus teach us, not that His Mother

merited no especial honour, nor the name of Blessed

’ iu all ooming ages, because she had been chosen by

the Eternal Word to give birth to Him in time3 but
that she was still more blessed in having heard, and
loved, aud ohserved the Divine Word.

ἶ Α similar lesson is taughtus by the last event in
’ the history of the Blessed Maiden‚ before the close

of the Redeemer’s life of trial. It is recorded by
three of the Evangelists. “While He talhed to the

’ people, behold His Mother and His brethren stood

without, desiring to speak with Him. Then one
said nuto Hirn, Behold ssy Mother and Thy bredr-
ren stand without, desiring to spealr widr Thee. But
He auswered aud said unto him that told Him‚ Who
is My Mother, and who are My brethreul And He
merehed forth His hand towards His disciples, and
said, Behold My Mother and My brethren! For

whosoever shall do the will of My Father Which is
in heaven, the sameis My brother, and sister, and

’ Mother².” He was then engaged in aDivine em·

ployment, and therefore He deelared that He knew
neither His Mother nor His brethren, while He was

fulfilling the work which He had come on earth

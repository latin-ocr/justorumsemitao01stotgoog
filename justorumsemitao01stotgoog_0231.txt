The saint did not remaiu very long in Antioch, but
retired to the desert of Chalcida, between Syris and
Arabia. Innocent and Heliodorus, and asleve named
Hylas, the companions of his joumcy from Italy, went
with him. Evagrius, who was rich, supplied him with
books and every thing neeessary3 for S. J erom hsd
brought with him little of this world's wealth, and
supported himself in the wildemess by the labour of
his hands. He devoted his time slso to study, during
the four years which he spent in those solitudes.
Two of his friends were soon taken from him by
death, and Heliodorus lest him to retum to the West.
He was himself afflicted with frequent sickness, and
still more terribly by temptatione to impurity‚ which
the remembrance of his former life of luxury in

Rome presented. Long ond severe penances at length
subdued his rebellious will. He has described the
calm which filled his soul, when the arts of the
temptet were overcome. “ The Lord is my witness,
that after many tears, after fixing my eyes on heaven,
1 sometimes seemed to myself to be present among
the choirs of angela, and in joy and gladness l sang,
‘Alter Thee will we run, because of the savour of
Thine ointments.’'’ As a further penance, he ap·
plied himself to the study of the Hebrew language.
lt was at first most galling to him to turn from the
polished writings of the Latin classica, in which he
took great delight, to its rude and uncouth sounds.
Alter surmounting many difficulties, and even more
than once giving up the task in despair, he gained a
perfect knowledge of the language‚ and found it of
infinite use in his sacred studies. He had for his
master a converted Jew.

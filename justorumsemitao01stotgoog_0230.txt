Many of thern became the intimate friends of S.
Jerom, and their history is often connected with his
own. The most eminent of these iss. Chromatius,
who succeeded S. Valerian in the see, and to whom
S. Jerom hae dedicated several of his works; and
Rufinus, whose later controversy with the saint has
made him famous. The monastic life seems to have
been practised among the brethren at Aquileia, pro-
bably according to the mle of the Egyptian ascetics,
which S. Athanasius had introduced into Italy during
hisexile. From Aquileia S. Jerom returned toRome.
lt is uncertain whether he then received holy bap-
tism, or whether it had been conferred on him by
Liberius, who died in 366, before hie joumey to
Gaul. The grace of purity, which was restored to
him in that mystery, he preserved inviolate till his
death.

In the year 373, he resolved to go into dre East,
that, amidst the soenes of our redemption‚ he might
have more leiaure for solitary study and contempla·
tion than he could enjoy at Rome. Evagrius, a
priest of Antioch, was about to return horne from
Italy, aster consulting Damasus, Birhop of Rome, on
the affairs of hia Church3 and S. J erom travelled with
him, attended hy three companions. They passed
into Thrace, and thence into Pontus, Bithynia, and

Galatia, and visited on their way many of the holy
tacetica who lived in retirement in those countn'ea
At Caesarea they had an interview with the great S.
Basil. They arrived safely at Antioch, where S.
Jerom became acquainted with Apollinaris. This
was a few years before his lamentable apostasy from
the catholic Faith.

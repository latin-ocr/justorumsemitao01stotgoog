aud of queen Mary ol Scotland, ol J ames Ι. of Eug-
lond‚ aud ol Charles ΙΙ. The abbats and religious of
the old monastery os S. Peter were sleeping there
when tbe changes of later ages brought desolation
upon their abode of peace. And many of the flower
of British chivalry have sougbt agrove there with
the hooded monks.

Alos! that it should so osten be our lot to moum
the decay of ancient piety and reverence‚ in the
subliment monuments of the devotion of other ages.
But if we are doomed to wander in the desolate
cathedral or abbey church‚ solitary and with sad
bearno, amidst the gay throng of visitors who sport
themselves where once tbe lroly dead were wont to
kueel‚wecn1motfeel alone while their remains are
so near. In each reclining figure, ιο humble‚ so
melancholy, with palrns so meekly joined, or hands
crossed upon the breast, iu-silent, unceasing suppli-
catiou, we seem to behold a brother in the mystical
communion of the Catholic sold. 11⁴ visions of the
old solemnities still haunt our imagination‚ the stately
procession, or the jubilant cboir, on a Christmas or
au Easter mom, we moy find comfort in the thought,
that those were but sbadows of what is even at this
bour passing around the eternal throne in the Church
above. Earthly temples may decay, and their glory
may pass away in evil times, but ol the city of God
it is written by the disciple of love, “l saw no

temple there, the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb
are the Temple of it.”

He lived in good lyls msny s yers,
Emporoure of grete powere,
And wissly gon he wate.

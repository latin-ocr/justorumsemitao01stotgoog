1 also his Lord. Let Mary thenbe deerned in herself
’ aholy Virgin and a vessel of sanctity. And it be-

. eomes us to think more honourably of her, lest we

share the guilt of high-mindedness, and discord, and
much speaking ¹.” And in another place he writes,
“ Let Mary be had in honour; let the Lord be wor-
ahipped².”
¹ The Nestorian heretica, who disturbed the peace
of the Church in the beginning of the fifth century,
denied that the Divina and human natures of Christ
’ form One indivisible Person, the Second in the most
, Holy Trinity. They taught that each of these na·
¹ turres ia a distinct Person3 and therefore denied the
right of the Blessed Virgin to her most ancient
title of the Mother of God3 because, as they said,
she is the Mother only of the hrunan Person. Their
¹ blasphemies were condemned by the council of
Ephesus in 431; ondit was declared to be the
Faith of the Catholic Church, that in the adorable
Person of the Lord Jesus tha two naturas are so
inseparably united, that she who is the Mother of
κ the human nature is truly the Mother of the Divine
ῃ Person3 though not of His Divine nature, which
it were an impiety to say. The council thus vindi·
¹ catedthe honour of the Lord Jesus in the person
of His Blessed Mother3 “ If any one does not
confess that Immanuel is truly God, and by conse-
quence, that the holy Virgin is the Mother of God,
becauoe she conceived, according to the flesh, the
word of God made Flesh‚ let him be anathema.”

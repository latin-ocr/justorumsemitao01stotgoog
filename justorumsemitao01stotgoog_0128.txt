Angustin and his clerks cried eamestly to God to
deliver them from their hands. In the third mouth
of the siege, he was attached by a violent fever, but
continued to perform the duties of his office while
his strength lasted. At length he was confined to his
conch, and felt his end approaching. He thought
that no Christian should leave the world without the
deepest penitense, and accordingly, to excite his own
he had the penitential psalms affixed to the walls
olbis chamber, near his bed. He recited them con-
tinually, with many tears. About ten days before
he departed, he desired that no one should enter his
thember, except at the hours when his physician
visited him, and when his l'ood was brought. The
rest of the time he passed in solitude, and iu unceas-
ing prayer. On the aeth of August he yielded up
his soul to Christ in the presence of his clerks and
religious brethren, who assisted him in his agony
with their prayers. Many bishops carne to his
funeral, and the adorable Sacrifica was solemnly
offered for his soul. His books, which were all that
he possessed in the world, he leit to the church of
Hippo. Many miracles attested his admission into
the society of the Saints.

A short time alter his decease, some priests in
Gaul ventured to call in question his doctrine. Pope
Celestin, in 431, wrote in his defence, and declared
him “ a man of holy memory, who has ever been in
our communion, sorbis merit, and against whom
there has never been a suspicion of evil; his leam·
ing was so great, that our predecessors have enrolled

him among the doctors; he was loved and honoured
by all the world.”

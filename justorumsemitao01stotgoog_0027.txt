'l'be people therefore petitioned pope Zachary that
the title of king might be given to him who already

Carloman. 'Ibe reason of this second coronation is
not well ascertained. Perhaps it was because the
throne of Franco was not vacant till the death of
Childeric in that year. During his stay at S. Denys,

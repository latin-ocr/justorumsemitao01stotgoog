lates the most remarkable of these appearancesz-

“ On a certain day, surrounded by a purple light, ἵ

that he might the more easily deceive him by the
cleamess of his assumed splendour, clothed in a

royal robe, and encircled with a diadem of gems and ,

gold, his sandala covered with gold, and with a
serene countenance and joyful mien, so that he might

be thought like nothing less than what he was, 'the
devil stood by Martin aa he was praying in his cell.

Then the devil first began: ‘¹ Acknowledge, Ο Mar· ,

tin, him whom thou seest. I am Christ, about to
descend to the earth, and Ι have willed to manifest
mysels first to thee.” Upon this Martin was silent,
and returned no answer3 but the devil dared to
repeat his bold profession: “ Martii, why dost thou
hesitare to believe, when thou seestl Ι arn Christ.”

Then the spirit revealing it to him, so that he under· ,

stood that it was the devil, and not God, he said,
“ The Lord J esus foretold not that 'He would come

in purple, and resplendent with a diadem: Ι will not

believe that Christ is come, except in that habit, and Ἰ
in the form in which He suffered, unless He show l

the marks os the Cross.’' At this word he vanished

instantly, like smoke, and filled the cell with so foul 3
an odour, as to leave undoubted proof that he was

the devil. This I had from Martin’s own lips, lest
any deern it fabulous¹.”

In 383, the emperor Gratian was murdered by
the soldiers, and Maximus obtained the empne, and

lixed his capital at Treves. S. Martin went thither ,
again, to beg for mercy sor some unhappy criminals.

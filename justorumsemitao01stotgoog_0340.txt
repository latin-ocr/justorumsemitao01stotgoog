a thing in the middle to put in the sacrament, when ¹
it is borne, weighing 341 ounces, the gili of John
Wellbome‚ treasurer.'’ A shrine of richer material
was asterwards made, for we read that, at the execu-
tion of the royal commission to seiae the gooda cf
the church‚ in June, 1540, “there were at that time 1
two shrines in the cathedra] church; the one of pure
gold, called S. Hugh's shrine, standing on the back 1
of the high altar: the place is easily to be known ¹
hythe irons yet fastened in the pavement stenes
there. The other, called S. John of Dalderby his
shrine, was os pure silvm, standing in the south end ,
of the great cross aisle'.” Some are of opinion that
one of these shrines of S. Hugh contained the relics
of a Christian child of that name, who was nailed to
across by the Jews of Lincoln‚ on Friday, the arth
of August, 1255, in contemptos Christ and His
Passion. ‘⁶ The perfidious Jews‚” says the English· ¹
Martyroloye‚ “when he was dead, buried his body
in an obscure place, which the earth miraculously
castup3 and theri they threw him into a well, who
being th'ere also hya miracle found out by bis owne
mother, the canons of the same city with great
veneration carried the same in procession to the
cathedral church or minster, and there interred his ¹
holy reliques, in the yeare of Christ 1255, and in the Ἰ
reign os King Henry ΙΙΙ. of England².'’ Chaucer

has commemorated this event in his Canterdary i
Talea⁸. ’

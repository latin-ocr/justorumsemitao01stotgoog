a few years, eight secular priests ventured to return,

Brithnoth the first abbat. In 974 the remaius of S.
Withburga, the yormgest sister of S. Etheldreda,
were translated thither from Derham in Norfollr.
K. Canute and queen Emma were liberal bene-

factors to the monastery. Towards the end of the ,
eleventh country, abbat Symeon laid the foundation ¹

the bodies ol S. Etheldreda, S. Sexburga, S. Ermi-

ance ol the final inconuption. This has come to

almost out of the world, by beholding the incorrup-

tion of the saints, may be more animated with faith =

and hope of the resurrection. There are five whom

other places claim more3 S. Etheldreda, S.Wiburgs, ³

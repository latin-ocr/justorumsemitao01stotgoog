Arianism. S. Sulpicius Severus, in his Life of S.
Martin, reoords many visione of the holy Maiden with
which the bishop of Tours was favoured. And once
be himself heard him eonversing with her, and with
S. Agnes aud S. Thecla. Tillemont says, that it is
impossible to doubt the truth of hir narrative, so

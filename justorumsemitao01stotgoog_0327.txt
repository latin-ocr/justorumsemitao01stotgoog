564, or 565.

S. Mscnurus, called also Maelovius, or Maclou,
was the son of a Welsh nobleman. He was bom in
the valley of Llancarvan, in Glamorganshire, about
the end of the fifth century. He was baptized and
edueated in the Christian Faith by S. Brendan, who
had come over from Ireland, and then lived in a
monastery in the same valley in which Machutus was
bom. From his childhood his sanctity is said to have
been attested by many miracles. There seems to be
little foundation for the report of his having been
elected to the bishopric os Godmanchester‚ in Hun-
tingdonshire, which some historiens ofhis life mention.
During the confusion which attended the insurrection
of Mordred against his uncle, King Arthur, towards
the middle of the sixth age, S. Machutus retired into
Brittany, then a favourite place of resort for holy
religious. He landed in an island where Aaron, a
devout ascetis, lived in angelis purity and contem-
plation with a few disciples. Machutus was admitted
into their society, and aster a time he was sent by his
superior to preach among the pagans who lived on
the opposite coast. He discharged this duty with
unwearied zeal, and about the year 541, he was
elected bishop of the infant church of Aleth. On the
death of Aaron, he succeeded him in the govemment
of the monastery. He invited the clergy of Aleth to
join the community, and thus increased it to seventy
brethren.

remonstrance which Cranmer offered. “For if the ,

honouring of the cross,” these are his words, “as
creeping and kneeling 'thereto‚ be taken away, it shall

y seem to many that be ignorant, that the honour of

l

muse of rescuing from the hands of the infidels the

' city which their dear Lord had hallowed by His

death. The two great military orders of the Hos·
pital and the Temple wore its sign on their garments.
And the memory of their devotion to it will be pre-

l

the militant church to the triumphant we can only
pass by the merita of Christ's suffering on the Cross.

Life, which S. John beheld in vision in the midst of
the city of God. It was commonly called the. Roode

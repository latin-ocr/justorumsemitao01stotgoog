says, ‘⁴ When Ι remember the teers which Ι shed at i

the chaunts of Thy Church, in the first days of my
recovered saith, and how Ι am still moved by them,
not indeed hy the song, but by the things which are
sung, when they are chaunted with a clear voice,

and suitable modulation, Ι acknowledge the great ¹

nsefulness of this institution ¹.” Many, whose hearts

were less inflamed with the divine love than his, in ⁴
succeeding agee, have felt the same. The poet sang ’

truly and heautiiiilly who likened music to ‘⁴ the
silver key of the fountain of tears‚” but his words

have a depth beyond his thought, when they are v

applied to the music of the Church. And itis
fitting that in the country of our exile our most joyous,

holiest feelings should be allied with tears. But ¹

above, there is a song, such as mortal ear has never
heard, “ which-no man can leam hut the hundred
end forty and four thousand, which were redeemed
from the earth3 for they are virgins, and they follow
the Lamb whithersoever he goeth ².” To hear thot

song, though he may never sing it, lesu grant to 1

every tearfiil penitent.

Blessed Saints 1 this broken rste
Blds our slowness ply its wings,

While your quiclt and active stote
Ever wakes ond ever sings.

Yet even this your school too was ;
And your now unwesried lays,

By this change ol song end pause
Herc ’mongst us you learned to raico.

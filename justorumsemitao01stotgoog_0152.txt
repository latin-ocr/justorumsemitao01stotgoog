true that S. Matthew and S. Luke‚ iu the passages
which l have quoted, use the word “espossed’·
insteadof“married.” But S. Lulre¹ employs the saruc
word. when he describes S. Mary as on the eve of the

Joseph before the birth of Christ, aud at the very
time when he mentions her as espoused to him, he
speaks of him as her husband². The Evangelist iu
the saruc place relates the appearance of the angel in
a dream to loseph, which happened soon oster the
return of S. Mary to Nazareth from the house of
S. Elisabeth. three months after the Annunciation,

be screened from the malignant tongue of calumny.
God was willing that some should doubt the miracle
of His birth, rather than that the breath of suspicion

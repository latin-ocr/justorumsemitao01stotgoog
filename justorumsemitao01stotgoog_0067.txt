day in the Roman Missal‚ S. Mary Magdalene is
mentioned aa the sister of Lazarus3 and the holy
Gospel contains the history of the washing of our
Saviour's feet by the “woman who was a sinner.’'
¹ The Office of Sarum connects S. Mary Magdalene
with the “sionem’' in these words of the collect;
‘⁶ Grant to us, Ο most merciful Father, that as the
blessed Mary Magdnlene, by loving Thine Only-
begotten Son above all things, obtained the pardon
of her sins, so she may gain for us from Thy mercy
eternnl bliss.” The lesson for the Epistle is that
appointed for holy women not virgins, and is taken
from Prov. xxxi. 10-31. The sequence, or hymn
aster the Epistle, commemorates the graeious meet-
ing of the Saviour with S. Mary Magdalene at the
sepulchre. The Gospel is the same as in the Roman

³ Office. But the Churches of Paris, Orleans‚ and

Vienne, and the order of Cluui, have carefully re-
moved from their Offices for this Feast any allusion
tn either of the other women.

It would lead us too far from contemplative stu-
dies, were we to examine the arguments upon which
these conflicting opinions rest. On reviewing the
whole circumstances, it seems less unlikely that S.
Mary Magdnlene and the ‘⁶ sinner'’ are the same
person3 or that the woman who anointed the Lord
iu the house of the Pharisee is the same as the sister
of Lazartis3 than that Mary of Magdala is one with
Mary of Bethany. On every side there are difficul-
ties, which some may hope to be able to solve. But
let no one imagine that the uncertainty in which this
question is left by the Catholic Church, hears any

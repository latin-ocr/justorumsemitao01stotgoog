Αο1111 11110 had said, “ Thou comest tome.”—Thou,
my Lord, shalt come after me to hell, whither 1
shall shortly go, by a bloody death. This idea is
also suggested by the Preface for this day in the
Sacramentary of S. Gregory. “ It is very worthy

and just, right and 11101111, that we should always
and everywhere give thanks to Tbee‚ O Holy Lord,
Almighty Father, Eternal God: Who didst endow
the Precursor of Thy Son with so great an honour
as that, for preaching the truth, he was beheaded:
and he who hed baptized Christ with water was in
spirit baptized by Him, and for Him was stained
with his own blood. He was indeed the preacher
01 Truth, which is Christ, and by forbidding Herod
his brother's nuptial couch was thrust into the dark-
ness 01 a prison, where he enjoyed the light 01 Thy
Divinity alone. Then he suffered the punishment 01
death, and descended into hell, as the precursor 01
his Lord: and Him Whom in the world he had
pointed out with his finger, he went before, by a pre·
010111 death, 10 the place 01 the departed. And
therefore with angels.”

The martyrdom 01 the blessed Precursor happened
probably not long before Easter in· the year 32. The
Greek and Latin Churches celebrate it on the 29th
of August, under the name of the Decollatiou of S.
John Baptist This was probably the day when a
trmrslation of his 1011111111 took place, or perhaps
when the church in Alexandria was consecrated in
his honour, on the ruins of the temple of Serapis, in
the end of the fourth century. This festival was
known in the Western Church before the time 01 S.
Gregory, and it is marked in the martyrologies 01 11111.

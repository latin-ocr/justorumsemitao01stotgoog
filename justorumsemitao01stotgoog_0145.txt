and in 1462, the ehoir was built. It was then within
die diocese of S. Andrew’s, and in the patronage of
the bishop of Lindiefame‚ and asterwards of the abbat
and canons of Dunfennline. It once contained about
forty altars, dedicated in honour of the saints. King
Jmnes ΙΙΙ., in 1466, erected it into a collegiate
church‚ with a pmvost, a curate, sixteen prebendam,
a minister of the choir, four choristas, aeaeristan,
and abeadle. Of later events Ι cannot speak‚ sor
very shame and grief of beart. “O God, the heathen
are come into Thine inheritance3 Thy holy temple
have they defiled, and made Jerusalem a heap of
stenes. The dead bodies of Thy servants have they
given to be meat unto the fowls of the air, and the
fleeh of Thy saints unto the beante of the land. . . .
Lord, how long wiltThou be angry3 shall Thy jealousy
burn like fite for ever? . . . 0 remember not our old
sins, but have merey upon us, and that soon, for we
are come to great misery.”

Israel yet heth thousande sealed,
Who to Bul never kneeled ;
Seize the hennei, epi-end its sold !
Scine it with no faltering bold¹ 1
spread ite ioldings high and fair,
Letalleeetbecmeeiethere!

God will aid the work began,

For the love of His dm Son ς

He will brenthe in their true bresith,
Who, serene in prayer end saith,
Would our dying embere fan
Brigbt ae when their glow began.

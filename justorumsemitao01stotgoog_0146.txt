340.

S. Eruncuos, or Evunriua, a subdeacon of the
Roman Church, came into Gaul early in the fourth
century. More than filty years before, a band ol
missionem had been sent from Rome to teach the
faith in that country, as we have already seen
in the life of S. Lucian. S. Enurchus was chosen
bishop of Orleans, and in the second year aster his
electiori, he saved the city from being destroyed by
lire. He consecrated a church in honour of the
Holy 'Crosa with some of its precious fragments
which he had·obtained from Jerusalem, through the
kindness of theg'emperor Constantine. He laboured
for more than twenty years in abolishing pagan super-
stition. And aller having converted nearly the whole
’ city to the Christian faith, he was taken to rest about
the year 340. The vault in which he was buried was
afterwards enlarged into a church, and became the
cemetery of the bishops of Orleans. His name is
famous in the western martyrologies, though few par-
ticulars of his life have been preserved. Three wans-
lations have been made of his relies. A celebrated
abbey at Orleans bears his name. Heia not now in·
cluded in the Roman kalendar, but he is honoured
with a commemoration, in the Parisian and other
Frenoh breviaries, on the 7 th of September.

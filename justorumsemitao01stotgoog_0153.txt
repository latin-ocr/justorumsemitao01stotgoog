holy martyr S. Ignatius of Antioch, the disciple of
S. John, has taught us another reason sor the mar-
riage os S. Mary‚ that the prinae of this world might
not know her to be a virgin, nor the manner in which
her Son was conceived, and might thus for a time bc
ignorant that He was more than a common child.
Not, as S. Bernard says, that God seared lest all the
power of the devils should hinder His mercy towards
mankind from attaining its final triumph, nor as if
Heoould not easily have preserved the honour of His
Son and of dre Blessed Virgin from the calumniosos
the Jews, or have prevented them from arising. But
He chooscs times when we shall admira His power,
and others when we shall adore His wisdom. Silence
was more befittinga mystcry designed to abase our
pride and teach us humility. And since, by deceiving
awoman, the devil had overcome the first man, it
was just that he himself should be beguiled by a
virgin, so that in the end he might be vanquirhed
by the Second Man, the Lord from heaven.
Accordingly, we observo, throughout the whole
lise of our Blessed Lord, that He was always reputed
among the Jews the sonos S. loseph and S. Mary. In
the city of Nazareth, where He was best known, the
people said of Him, when they beheld His miracles,
and heard His words, “ Whence hath this man this
wisdom, and these mighty workal Is not this the
carpenter’s sonl Is not His mother called Mary'l’¹

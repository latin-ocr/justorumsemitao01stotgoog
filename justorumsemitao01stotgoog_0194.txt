436 exstrarrou or [sarr. 14.

means an image. The screen‚ or Roodlofh which
supported it, was generally of stone in cathedral and
abbey churches, aud of n'chly carved wood in smaller
buildings. The epistle and holy gospel at Mass were
sung from it, as well as many other parts of the
sacred offices. And hence it is frequently called the
debe, from the first word of the sentence, Jube domne
benedicere, Sir, command a blessing‚ with which the
chaunter or reader sought the benediction of the chief
minister. The Rood itself was usually floriated, and
omamented with sacred devices‚ as the emblema of
the four evangelista. “ It isworthy of remark‚” says
Mr. Pugin, ‘⁶ that the ancient crosses were all richly
decorated, in order to set forth that the very instru-
ment on which our Redeemer suffered an ignominious
death had become the emblem of His glorious victory
over sin audite punishmfflt and should therefore be
omamented as the figure of this great triumph and
our redemption. The old mysticel school of Christian
painters invariably figure our Lord with extended
anns on the Crosa, not through ignorance of drawing,
but to represent the Son of God embracing the sins
of the whole world¹.”

These lines were often inscribed underneath the

rood :-

Churches, and among others into the Latin. These
became ao multiplied, that in the fourth century

hardly any copies of the Latin translations agreed
with each other. The most correct was called the

Ι Italic, probably from being used chiefly in Italy. S.

Damasus engaged S. Jerom, during his visit to
Rome in 382, to revise the translation of the holy

Gospels, and to compare it with the original Greek.
He asterwards did the same with the rest of the New

Testament. This translation insensihly took the

of the books of the Old Testament‚ by comparing it
with the Greek Septuagint. He twice revised the

¹ psalter in the same manner. Allerwards‚ he pro-

³ original Hebrew‚ into Latin3 amore laborious work.

His version was received in many churches in the
time of S. Gregory the Great, who gives it the pre-
ference. S. Isidore, bishop of Seville, also in the
sixth age, writes that all the Churches used it.
They retained in the Divine Offlce the first version
of the psalter which S. Jerom had made from the

books which were not extant in Hebrew when he
wrote, and which still remain as in the ancient Vul-

gate. The psalter is his second amended version
from the Greek. ln the church of the Vatican at

tival was kept upon it, though the event happened
shortly before Easter. His chains were kept there,
and were held in great veneration. This church now

suppose thatin some parts of the Chureh at least this
miraele would be related aa often as the feast re-
tumed‚ and so in time Kalendae Aequati was changed
to Galo Augusti.

“ I make no question,” says Heme, the learned
antiquary‚ ‘⁴ but thia famous accident was formerly,
before the pulling down and making havock of the
religione houses, (a most dismul thing) mueh talked
of, and mentioned too, annually‚ in the sermons and
homilies on the feast of S. Peter’s chains among us
in England, though it be now quite forgotten. Nay
they did not mention such things only in their ser-
mons and homilies‚ but ostentimes in their thanks-
giving prayers. It were to be wished that this eus·
tom had not been broke off. People would by that
means have been better able to tell who were the
founders of their ehurohes, and to [the honour of]
what saints they were dedicated ¹.” This explanation
of the word Yule is oonfinned by Cowel, in his Law
Dietionary.

brethren. He replied that he would keep the peace
of the Lord Jcsus. He entered by night, and went
to the church to pray3 and the next day he pre·
sented himself at the palaoe. Maximus received
him with respect, but put off granting his petition for
afew days. Meanwhile the bishops, seeing that S. ⁴
Martin kept aloof from their communion, represented
to the emperor that their reputation was at an end if
the obstinacy of Theognostus was encouraged by the
authority of Martin. They said that he ought not to
have been allowed to come into the city3 and that
they had gained nothing by the death of Priscillian,
if the bishop of Tours became his avenger. They
threw themselves at the emperor’s feet, and conjured
him with tears to employ force against him.

But Maximus dared not use violence towards the
saint, though he was attached to the cause of the
bishops. He took him aside, and mildly argued Χ
with him that the heretics had been justly con-
demned by, a sentence of the bishops, and that he
had no good reason for refusing to communicate
with Ithacius; he said that Theognostus alone op-
posed him, and that a council, only a few days before,
had pronounced him innocent of any crime. S. Martin
was unmoved by any of these reasons, and the
emperor lett him in great ¹anger, and issued orders
for the instant execution of the persons for whom he
had interceded. The news reached the saint late at
night. He ilew to the palaea, and promised to com-
municate with the Ithacians on the next day, if the
lives of the condemned were spared, and if the

tribunes were recalled from Spain. Maximus granted
all that he asked.

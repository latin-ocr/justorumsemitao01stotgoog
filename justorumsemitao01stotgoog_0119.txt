l early in 391. As he desired still to live in retire-
ment, Valerius gave him ahouse and garden belong·

ing to the church of Hippo; and there he assembled
all those who aspired to serve God in celibacy and
voluntary poverty. He had sold his own little pa·

’ trimony, and brought nothing to Hippo but the
clothes which he wore.

Valerius granted him permission to explain the
holy Gospel to the people in his presence ς a privi-
lege which the African bishops then reserved to
dremselves. S. Angustia begged for time to prepare
himselss which was granted3 and at Easter he began
to preach with such success, that other hishops soon
followed the example os Valerius. His time was
also much occupied in opposing the Manichean
heresy. He held a public conferente with Fortu-
natus, a priest of the sect, which lasted two days,
and in which the fallacies- of his adversary were
completely exposed.

Aurelius, the newly-elected bishop of Carthago,
had written to S. Augustin, to beg his prayers and
his good counsel. The saint, in reply‚ recommended
him to correct the abuses which had for some time
disgraced the celebration ol the festivals of the mar·
tyrs; and particularly the 'riotous feasts which were
osten held at their tombs. An African council,
which Aurelius summoned in 393, condemned them,
and at the same time approved of the ancient and
godly custom of offering alms at the tombs of the
holy martyre and of the faithfirl departed. Sucha
practice is enjoined in Tobit iv. 17. The people
were with great difficulty restrained from violence,
so unpopular were the restrictione os the oouncil.

Mary,the wife ofCleophas,andthe mother of &tames

the Less aud of tereph, was the sister of the Blessed
virgin, aa S. John relates¹. This was understood
literally by many of the fathers, though some have
explained it according to the wider meaning which
Scriptura sometimes gives to the name of brother or
sister. The Blessed Virgin was also related to S. Eli-
zabeth, the mother of S.J0hnBaptist. “Manybefore
ber were called Mary,” says S. Ambrose‚ “ for the sis·
ter of Aaron was so named. But Mary means the bit-
terness of the sea. So the Lord comes in the bitterness
of human frailty‚ to sweeteu the bitterness of our
condition, and temper it with the sweetness and grace
of the celestial word².” S. Isidore, bishop ofSeville,
in the seventh century, interprete her name to mean
‘⁶ Stella Maris-the Star of the sea3 for she gave
birth to the Light of the world.” So also S. Bemard
says, that “ the Virgin-Mother is well compared to a
star, because as astar sends forth its ray without in*
jury to itself‚ so she brought forth her Son without
prejudice to her virginity.'' There quotations are
mentioned with approbation by bisbop Pearson, in his
Expositioa os the Greed.

We may leam how the Blessed Mary spent her
childhood and early youth from the gracious as·
suranco of the angel, that she had “ found favour with
God.” “To this man will Ι look,'’ saith the Lord,
“even to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit,
and trembleth at My word⁸.’' The devotion of her
tender years to His service has been celebrated by
many holy fathers. Among these are SS. Hilary,

that a severer punishment might be in store for bis
innocent people‚ went himself to court, to defend his
own conduct. Some of bis friends went to meet

owing to the murder of the blessed S. Thomas of
Canterbury, about twenty years before, and they
dreaded tbe consequentes of his unbending resolu-

king at Mass, and went immediately to him, and
constrained him, almost by force, to embrace him,
to the wonder of all present. When the Pax¹‚ or
symbol of peace, was offered to Richard‚ he desired
that it should be carried first to S. Hugh, as a token
of reconciliation. It was remarked, that he soon
afterwards gained a signal victory over bis enemim,
as a reward for the honour which he paid to the holy
bishop. Aster Mass was ended, S. Hugh took the king
aside, and remonstrated with bim on his manner of
life, and made him solemnly promise to amend it.

rated into evil, the kiss was by degi-ees done away; snd
instead of it,a small tablet, or dise, with the image of the
Cross, or of Christ, upon it, was offered to each. It was
usually ol gold or silver, richly chased and anamelled ; and it
was called the Poe, and by later writers the, damaratum

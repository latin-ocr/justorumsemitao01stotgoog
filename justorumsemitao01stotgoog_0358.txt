Prince of the apostles to Rome, and was ordained to

the episcopata by his venerable hands, in order, as ¹

some historiam say, that during the frequent absence

of S. Peter from Rome on the affairs of the Church, ἶ
there might always bea person in the city ready to ¹

discharge the functions of a bishop. Others are of

opinion that he was appointed a missionary bishop ⁴
among the heathen at a short distance from Rome. ¹

He may have been consecrated to the pastoral care
of the Jews in the city, whose govemment, in the

infancy of the Church, was very different from that a

of the Gentiles. Or, again, he may have been only
appointed to assume his authority on the decease of

S. Peter. But, as S. Cyprian observes that none ⁴

of the Apostles were properly diocesan bishopr, S.
Clement may he easily supposed to have been Bishop
of Rome in the lifetime of S. Peter, without impeir-
ing the unity of the One chair.

But aster the glorious martyrdom of SS. Peter and

Paul, in the year 66, it is certain that S. Clement ¹

for some reason did not insist on his right to succeed
to the vacant see; aud S. Linus was elected Bishop.
He is supposed to have been the same person whose
salutation S. Paul sent to Timothy in his second
Epistle from Rome, in 65¹. Pudens and Claudia,
who are mentioned with him, were perhaps his
parents. He died in 78, and was succeeded by
S. Cletus, or Anacletus‚ as his name is osten writ-

ten, who filled the see till the year 90. In the ¹

following year S. Clement was invested with the
episcopal authority. The event was formerly com·

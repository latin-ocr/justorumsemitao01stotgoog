governor ο1 the province. He it was who afterwards

Ἴ in Spain tormented the holy martyr S. Vincent. S.
Faith endured with firmness a lingering torture.
Many who beheld her constancy were converted to

. the saith, and afterwards shared her triumph. She
was at length beheaded, confessing Christ with her
last breath. Τ110 martyr S. Caprais is sometimes
mentioned as her campanica, though he is comme-
morated in the martyrologies on the toth 01 October.
The Christiana buried their bodies during the
night. About the middle 01 the fifth age, S. Dulci-
tius, bishop of agen, built a church in honour ο1 S.
Faith, and translated her relies into it. The remeius

of S. Capreis, andos the other martyrs who suffered

at the same time, he carried into another church in

the city. In the ninth century the relies 01 S. Vin-

, cent 01 Agen and 01 S. Faith were removed to the
abbey· 01 Conques‚ and in 1050 into the new church

i 01 the same house. Pope Urban V. in 1365 be-
t stowed part 01 the remains 01 S. Faith on the
monastery 01 Cucufat in Catalonia. An arm was
formerly preserved at Glastonbury. S. Faith was
chosen as the patroness 01 many churches in France.
The Benedictine priory 01 Horsham in Norfolk was
dedicated in her honour by Robert Fitzwalter and

his wife Sybilla in 11053 and was endowed by king

2 Henry 1. A church under the invocation 01 S.
² Faith existed in London before the year 1087. In
t 1312, the crypt underneath the choir 01 S. Paul’s
Cathedral was set apart for it. The whole building

was consumed in the fire ο1 1666. A chapel 01 the
same name is used as a cemetery in dre modern

strong.

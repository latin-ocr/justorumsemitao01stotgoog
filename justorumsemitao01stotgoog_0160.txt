S. Baail remarks, that though the opinion of some
heretico, who deny thia, doec not touch the founda-
tion of our faith, for which it is enough that S. Mary
remained a Virgin till the birth of our Lord, yet the
earn of tbe faithful ought not to suffer any one to say
that ohe ever ceaoed tobe so. S. Augustin maintains
that thia ia apoint of Apostolic doctrine, following
directly from her language to the angel ⁸. We may
say, with Tillemont, that the Church makes a public
profession of it in the Creed‚ and whenever the name
of the Bleaced Virgin is uttcred3 for by no other is
che ιο universally known. Those who denied it have
always been placed by the Church among heretica.
In the end of the third century, a sect arose, chiefly
in Arabia, called Antidicomarianites, or “ Enemies
of Mary.'’ They eaid that our Blesced Ladye had
other aona, aster the birth of 'the Redeemer, who are
called in Scripture His brethren. In their general
creed they were followera of Eunomiua, the denier
of our Lord’c divinity, and some of thern were the
disciplec of Apollinaris, who taught that He had not
a human eoul. At Rome, Helvidius defended their
inventione regarding S. Mary‚ and waa refirted by S.
J erorn in a macterly treatire, which rtill remains
unanswered by tbe bold impugners of ber perpetual

Virginity. S. Ambrose also, and S. EpiphaniuS,

was honourably received at the Norman court. The
sudden death of Sweyn, within a short time aster,
opened a way for his return, and on the conclusion
of a treaty with the English nobles he renewed the
war with the Dones, at first with some success. But
fresh forces arriving from Denmark‚ his fortunas
were again brought to the verge of ruin, when death
released him from his troubles in 1016. His son
Edmund, queen Emma, and S. Edward‚ were in
London with him when he expired.

The greater part of the kingdom then submitted to
the Danish conqueror, hut the citizens of London
supported the claims of Edmund, the eldest son of
Ethelred. The doubtful issue of the war was settled
by their dividing the kingdom between thern. But
Edmund survived the partition only seven months.
In 1017 he was barbarously murdered by Edric,
count of Marcia, who hoped to recommend himself
to Canute by removing his rival. The king was
buried at Glastonbury, near the remeius of his grand·
father Edgar. His two sons, Edwin and Edward,
were sent into Sweden, that they might be secretly
put to death. But Olave the king took pity upon
them, and allowed thern to retire to the court of
Stephen, king of Hungary‚ who received them with
kindness. Edwin soon died; and Edward married
Agatha, the sister of Stephon. ¹Their son Atheling,
and their daughters Margaret and Christina, became
afterwards celebrated in Bn'tish history.

ln the meanwhile Canute had seiaed the whole
kingdom but as if to atone for thls act of injustice,
he punished Edric and the other murderers of K.

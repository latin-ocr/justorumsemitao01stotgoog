ample of the blessed martyr S. Agnes. They re·
joioed to hear her resolution, and her noble dower

was given to the poor. She received the veil frorn
the hands of the bishop oi Carthage. Her example
incited many others to devote themselves to the
same holy life. The report of her sanctity passed
into the East, and reached S. ierom, who wrote to
ber, recommending manual labour to all who had
embraced the life of religion. S. Augustin saw her
during his stay at Carthage while the Donatist con·
lerence lasted. He afterwards wrote to her on seve·
raloeoesions. Pelagius tried, bnt in vain, to gain
ber to his party.

Orosius, a young Spanish priest, who had distin-
guished himself by his zeal against the Priscillianum
and other hereties in Spain, passed into Africa, on
his way ιο the East, in 415. S. Augustin furnished
him with letters to S. J erom. He returned in the tol-
lowing year, bringing withhim letters from S. J erom,
and relies of S. Stephen the first martyr, which
had been then recently discovered near Jerusalem.

In 417, the Dtmatists having again disturbed the
peace of the Church, S. Augustin wrote to Boniface‚
the governor, a letter in which he defends the prin-
ciple of restraining heretics by temporal punishment.
He sets forth its usefulness in repressing their ex·
oesses, and in bringing back to the Chureh many
doubtfirl persons. He argues, thetis other crimes
may be punished, why may not sacrilege3 and quotes,
as an authority in his favour, the words of our Sa-
viour, “ Go into the highways and hedges, and com-
pel them to come in¹.”

Syria, in the year 453. Marcellus, an abbat who
lived there, was directed in a dream where to find it;
audhe has related the history of its discovery. It
had been carried thither, probably by some faithful
disciple, aster the malice of Herodias had done its

vorst. On tbe nath of February, it was translated
into the bishop’s church; aud, not long aster, a new
church was dedicated in its honour. Finally, in 760,
astill larger building was erected to receive it, where
numerous miracles continued to make it illustrious,
eren aster the Sarazins were in possession of the
nty.

Thence it was translated to Constantinople, in the
beginning of the uinth century. Wallo de Sarton, a
canon of the church of Amicus, was present when
the French took Constantinople in 1204, and obtained
nearly the whole of this precious relic. He brought
it to Amiens, where it is still preserved. Other
churches in France also claim the possession of part
ol the remains of the holy Baptist.

Careless of tbine own honour, thou to cesse
Didst hasten, bke the star before the day,
Willing thyself to vanish hence away,-

''fis meet that thou depart, and He increase.

But not alone shalt thou with thy lise's breath

Beur witness‚-one thing yet to thee remeius,
Boldly the truth to speak, and bear the chains,
And go before thy Lord in murderous death.

llymns from the Parisinu Breviary, p. 214.

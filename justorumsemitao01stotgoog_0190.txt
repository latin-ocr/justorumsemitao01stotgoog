Durandus teaches us the same lesson when he
says, “ The depth signifies saith, which is the foun-

Ι know not how to speak of the deep veneration
with which the catholic Church has ever regarded
the precious woodof the Cross. lt is proclaimcd by
her liturgies, her festivals, and the holy words and
deeds of her most devoted children. They believed
it to be inseparable from the adoration which a re-
deemed world owes to the Authoi of its ransom.
Far removed indeed, as heaven from earth, was the
worship which they offered to Him, from the reve·
rence which they paid to His Crosa. But their
grateful love refused to be confined within the nar-
row limits which the cold judgment of a modern age
would prescribe. It embraced every thing that had
approached Him, the earth which He had trod, and
the instrumenta of His death. And it would ill be·
come us to blame them, till we can form some con·
ception, even the faintest, of the unutterable devo-
tion of their inmost souls to their Lord J esus. Their
reverence for the Crosa exceeded our worship of the
Crucified. That it was therefore too great, is not
the only conclusion that may follow. May not our
poor and constrained devotion give token of hearts
too much at home on earth to measure the love of
seraphic spirits? Could we only descend from the
scats of partial judges to the more becoming attitude
